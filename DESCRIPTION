Description: It provides a new method for online modeling and prediction of nonlinear and nonparametric autoregressive time series. It uses splines to approximate a wide range of nonlinear functions and adaptive filtering to accommodate time varying data generating processes. It is built on a new online group LASSO algorithm proposed in the reference paper. It can be applied to high dimensional time series where the dimension is larger than the sample size.
